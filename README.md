# AlgoBytes - Daily DSA Challenges

**"Wordle meets LeetCode"** – A minimalist, gamified platform for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.

AlgoBytes transforms traditional coding practice into an engaging daily habit. Instead of writing code from scratch, users drag and drop logic blocks to assemble optimal solutions, focusing on algorithmic thinking over syntax memorization.

## Key Features

- **Daily Challenge**: A fresh algorithmic puzzle every 24 hours. Keep your streak alive!
- **Drag & Drop Coding**: Intuitive block-based interface using `@dnd-kit`. No syntax errors, just pure logic.
- **Practice Lab**: Unlock and revisit past challenges categorized by topic (Arrays, Strings, Trees, etc.).
- **Instant Validation**: Real-time feedback on your solution with test case visualization.
- **Social Sharing**: Share your innovative solutions and daily streaks with a single click.
